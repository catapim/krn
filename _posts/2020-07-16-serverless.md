Get your environment ready to develop and deploy Serverless apps in AWS.

It's very important to understand that Serverless is used as a concept and as a Framework.

Learn the differences here:
- [Serverless architectures by Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html)
- [Framework](https://www.serverless.com)

If you are taking your fists steps in develop, test and deploy a serverless application in AWS, remember this checklist.

- Is the project in Python or JavaScript?
- Install the required language. Visit the page of your OS:
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)

Wether your project is Python or Node, you will need NPM.  It's distributed with Node.

Pick a friendly IDE! My favourite is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

You'll need:
- [AWS Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) (access key id and secret access key)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
- [setup your AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) (this allows you to deploy from yor local machine to the cloud)
- [Install Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)


## What to do next

Serverless is strongly related to Lambda! An AWS service that let's you do very cool stuff.

This little step by step will help you to write, deploy and test your first function:
